### 🛡️ Public Safety Rules Poster

As part of my graphic design internship at **Oasis Infobyte**, I designed a public awareness poster titled **"Public Safety Rules"** to educate and inform the public about essential safety practices. The poster features six key safety guidelines: obey traffic lights, avoid stranger danger, report suspicious activity, stay calm in crowds, don’t play on roads, and dispose of waste properly. It is visually appealing, using soft colors, clear typography, and friendly illustrations to make the content easy to understand for both children and adults. The layout guides the viewer through the information step-by-step, making it suitable for use in schools, community centers, and public campaigns. This project demonstrates my ability to communicate important messages through clean and engaging visual design.
